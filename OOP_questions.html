        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Student Info System</b><br>
                Create a Student class with name, age, and grade. <br>
                Add methods to display student info and update grade.<br>
                Focus on encapsulation (use private fields + getters/setters).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Animal Sounds</b> <br>
                Create a base class Animal with a method makeSound().<br>
                Subclass it into Dog, Cat, and Cow, each overriding makeSound().<br>
                Create a list of animals and call makeSound() on each. <br>
                Focus on inheritance and polymorphism.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Shape Area Calculator</b> <br>
                Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method getArea(). <br>
                Implement Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle classes that extend Shape. <br>
                Write a method to calculate and print the area of each shape.<br>
                Focus on abstraction and using abstract classes properly.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Employee Salary System</b> <br>
                Create a base class Employee with name and baseSalary.<br>
                Create subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.<br>
                Each subclass should have its own logic for calculating total pay.<br>
                Add a method in each class: calculatePay().<br>
                Create a list of employees and print their total salaries.<br>
                Focus on inheritance, overriding, and runtime polymorphism.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Bank Account System</b><br>
                Create an abstract BankAccount class with account number and balance.<br>
                Add deposit and withdraw methods with validation.<br>
                Create SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount subclasses with their own withdrawal rules (e.g., min balance or overdraft limit).<br>
                Add a Bank class that manages multiple accounts.<br>
                Implement methods to add new accounts, remove accounts, and find accounts by number.<br>
                Focus on abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and managing objects in a collection.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Vehicle Management System</b><br>
                Create a base class for Vehicle with fields like brand, model, and maxSpeed. <br>
                Add a method startEngine() that prints a generic message. <br>
                Create two subclasses: Car and Motorcycle, each overriding startEngine() with their own version. <br>
                Each subclass should have one additional field unique to it (e.g., Car has number of doors, Motorcycle has helmet storage). <br>
                In your main class, create an array or list of Vehicle references storing both Car and Motorcycle objects. <br>
                Loop through the list and call startEngine() on each object.
