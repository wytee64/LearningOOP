    </div>
    <h3>simple exercises.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a class Book with fields title, author, and price. Instantiate 2 books and print their details.</li>
        <li>Create a class Rectangle with length and width. Add a method getArea() that returns the area.</li>
        <li>Create a class Student with name, age, and a method introduce() that prints "Hi, Iâ€™m [name], age [age]".</li>
        <li>Create a class Car with a method startEngine() and a field model. Create an object and call the method.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Advanced exercises.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create a way to represent a book. Each book has a title, author, and whether it's available or not. <br>
            You should be able to borrow a book (which makes it unavailable) and return a book (which makes it available again). <br>
            Create a separate class that represents a library. It should store multiple books. <br>
            The library should have a method to add books and another to list all available books. <br>
            Write code that adds at least 3 books, borrows one, and then prints the available books before and after borrowing.
        </li>
    </ol>
